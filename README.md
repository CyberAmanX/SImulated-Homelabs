# 🧪 Simulated HomeLabs

Welcome to **Simulated HomeLabs** – a curated collection of virtual, self-hosted, and cloud-based experiments where I simulate real-world IT environments and cybersecurity scenarios. These projects are hands-on, educational, and designed to sharpen skills across **networking**, **cybersecurity**, **automation**, **server management**, and more.

Whether you're a fellow learner, job-seeker, or tech enthusiast — this repo offers a gateway into how things *really* work behind the scenes.

## 🌐 Why Simulated HomeLabs?

In today's digital world, theory isn't enough. With **Simulated HomeLabs**, I bring concepts to life by building:
- Realistic attack/defense simulations
- Virtual enterprise networks and systems
- Custom monitoring and automation tools
- Security scanning and vulnerability management labs
- Cloud and hybrid deployments

> 🚀 **Learn by Doing. Break to Build. Experiment to Evolve.**
